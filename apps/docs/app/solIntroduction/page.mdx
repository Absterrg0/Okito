# UI Integration in Solana


This section introduces the essential hooks and components from the Solana Wallet Adapter that are key for integrating Okito into your dApp. Leveraging these tools will streamline wallet connectivity and user experience.

## UI Components

The Solana Wallet Adapter offers a suite of ready-made UI components to simplify wallet connection, selection, and management in your application. These components save you from building wallet logic from scratch and enhance your development workflow.

We provide dedicated documentation for important features like 
- [`WalletMultiButton`](/walletMultiButton) 
- [`useConnection`](/useConnection) 
- [`useWallet`](/useWallet).
