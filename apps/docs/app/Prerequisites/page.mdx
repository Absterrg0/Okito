# Prerequisites

Before you can integrate the Okito SDK, there are a few things you'll need to have set up in your development environment. This guide will walk you through the necessary tools and packages to ensure a smooth start.

## 1. Node.js Environment

The Okito SDK is a JavaScript/TypeScript package and requires a Node.js environment to run.

- **Node.js:** We recommend using the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Package Manager:** You will also need a package manager. This guide will use `pnpm`, but `npm` or `yarn` work just as well.

You can check if you have Node.js and npm installed by running:

```sh 
node -v
npm -v
```

## 2. Project Setup

The Okito SDK is designed to work seamlessly in modern front-end applications, especially those built with React or Next.js. Your project should be set up to handle React components and hooks.

If you are starting a new project, we recommend using Create Next App:

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest my-solana-app
```

## 3. Solana Wallet Adapter

To sign transactions on the front end, your application must be able to connect to a user's Solana wallet (like Phantom, Solflare, etc.). The Okito SDK requires a wallet object that conforms to its `SignerWallet` interface.

The easiest way to achieve this is by using the official Solana Wallet Adapter libraries.

### Installation

Install the necessary wallet-adapter packages for React:

```sh filename="terminal"
pnpm add @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui 
pnpm add @solana/wallet-adapter-base @solana/web3.js
```


You will also want to install adapters for the specific wallets you want to support:

```sh
pnpm add @solana/wallet-adapter-wallets
```

Once these packages are installed, you will need to wrap your application in the required providers. Please refer to the [official Solana Wallet Adapter documentation](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter) for instructions on setting up the providers in your application.
